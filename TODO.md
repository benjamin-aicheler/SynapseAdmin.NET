# TODO

<!--
HOW TO USE THIS FILE (instructions for the AI agent):
- This is the SINGLE-TASK execution checklist derived from the approved PLAN.md (ignore if PLAN.md is blank template or Done).
- Work on ONE task at a time, top to bottom within "Next Up", unless the user says otherwise.
- Before starting a task: move it to "In Progress".
- After finishing a task: verify it (`dotnet build` & `dotnet test`), tick the checkbox, move it to "Done"
  with the date and a short note (e.g. commit hash or files changed).
- If you discover new work, add it to "Backlog" or "Bugs / Follow-ups" – do not silently expand the current task.
- If a task is blocked, move it to "Blocked" with the reason and what is needed.
- Keep entries short. Reference PLAN step IDs (e.g. [1.2]) and spec IDs (e.g. FR-15, AC-10).
- ON COMPLETION (before merging the PR, or before starting the next task): finalize `[Planned]` items in SPEC.md and clear/reset this file (and PLAN.md) back to the blank template from `main` (optionally preserving any real unresolved follow-ups in Backlog, or moving them to GitHub Issues).
